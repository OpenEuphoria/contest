I've been thinking about this for a little while now. Let's have some
programming fun! To encourage 4.0 use and the testing thereof, let's have a
little contest. Depending on how it goes, we may make this into a weekly thing
for a while. The rules overall rules are simple... Complete the task in Euphoria
(any version), include in a comment at the top of the file your OpenEuphoria
user name. The scoring is a little more complex (and can be modified for the
next contest if good ideas are given):


# 1 point is given for completing the task according to the spec
# 1 point is given for using Euphoria 4.0
# 1 point is given for each 4.0 language construct you use
# 1 point is given for each 4.0 standard library method you use
# 1 point is given if your program is in the top 20% for speed
# 1 point is given if your program is in the top 20% for LOC (smallest, not largest!)... comment lines do not count

\\
This is basically going to be on the honor system. Each person submitting should
count the total points they earn (besides the last two of course) and submit
that as a comment in the top of the file. Why? It would be a lot of work for one
person to figure this out for all the submissions. We are doing it for fun. Now,
if someone is caught cheating... that wouldn't be very cool, play nice!


Ok... So, let's say the contest was "Create a program that says 'Hello, World!'"
... A possible submission would be:

<eucode>
-- User: jeremy
-- 3 points (per spec, 4.0, 1 library method)

include std/text.e
puts(1, trim("Hello, World!\n"))
</eucode>

(trim added for point scoring example only!). Do not count each use of a method,
only count once.

Ok... So, let's start with a simple contest for our first one...

**LCD Numbers**

Accept on the command line any number of arguments. Each argument will be a
number up to 5 digits long. The program should output on their own line each
number in a standard text based LCD number. A single space should be placed
between each number. Numbers should look like:

{{{
     --    --        __   --   --   --   --   --
 |     |     | |  | |    |       | |  | |  | |  |
 |     |     | |  | |    |       | |  | |  | |  |
     --    --   --   --   --        --   --   
 |  |        |    |    | |  |    | |  |    | |  |  
 |  |        |    |    | |  |    | |  |    | |  |
     --    --        --   --        --        --
}}}

They are 4 characters wide and 7 characters tall. An extra point will be given
if your program takes an extra parameter to vary the digit size proportionately.
i.e. 3x5, or 8x14, etc. i.e. 3x5 would be:

{{{
    _
 |   |
    -
 | |
    -
}}}

The parameter should be the width: 3, 4, 5, 8, 256 :-)

Sample: 

{{{
$ lcd -w 4 343
 --        -- 
   | |  |    |
   | |  |    |
 --   --   -- 
   |    |    |
   |    |    |
 --        -- 
}}}

Submissions should be made via email to myself, jeremy (spat) cowgar/com.
Submissions will be accepted through Saturday morning, December 4th, no later
than 9am EST. The winner will be announced that evening. Discussion can occur on
the forums about the contest if you wish but code should not be put on the forum
on how to accomplish the task in whole or part.

We can discuss the contest, scoring, future "problems" to solve, since this is
the first one. I thought it may be fun to allow the winner of this contest to
choose and accept the submissions of the next contest in order to allow everyone
to participate in the fun (i.e. in this one it wouldn't really be fair for me to
compete as I could wait for everyone's to come in and pick the best one stealing
ideas for each one if I wanted :-/).


I hope everyone has fun with this idea and that we get a lot of submissions.

Have Fun w/the contest!

Jeremy
